        <h1>Near Future Goals</h1>
    <p>I am very much drawn towards Start-up Culture and Entrepreneurship, my first aim is establishing my own Start-up within the next Few years. I also have been working on it lately.</p>
    <p>However, I believe there must always be a 'Plan B' which is none other than Product/Project Management for me.</p>
    <p>Why Product Management?</p>
    <p>The answer is the simplest one 'A Product Manager is the entrepreneur of that specific product/feature'</p>
        <h1>Far Future Goals</h1>
    <p>In 10 years, I see myself in three ways</p>
    <ol>
      → A person running a start-up and striving to invest in upcoming start-ups along with forming a new Start-up solely for Passive Income and <em>Lifelong Wealth<em> (<em>Wealth</em>: The best definition is the number of years you can survive without Earning even for a Single Day)
    </ol>
    <ol>
      → A Successful Product Manager turned budding entrepreneur aiming to establish a Business in the field of Fooding Industry.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      → A Product Manager happy with his Job and aiming for higher growth of company as well as Individual.
